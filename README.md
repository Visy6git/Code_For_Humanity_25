This our project for PAC-HACK 2024 .

Overview
In rural India, accessing social services can be a daunting task due to complex application processes, unclear information, and limited communication channels. Government schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, designed to support health, economic well-being, and social security, are often underutilized. This is primarily due to bureaucratic hurdles, low literacy levels, and inadequate language support.

Our AI platform addresses these challenges by simplifying the application process, clarifying scheme information, and providing personalized assistance. By bridging the gap between available services and the communities that need them most, we aim to enhance accessibility and utilization of these critical programs.
