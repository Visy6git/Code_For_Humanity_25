An overview of various key provisions for women workers \nis as under:\na. The Factories Act, 1948 (Chapter V) incorporates provisions to ensure the welfare of women workers. These \ninclude the establishment of canteens, restrooms, \ufb01rst aid boxes, facilities for sitting, washing, storing, and \ndrying cloths, and cr\u00e8ches for women workers within the factory premises. These welfare measures aim to \nprovide a favorable and comfortable working environment for women, addressing their speci\ufb01c needs for \nhealth, hygiene, and childcare.\nb. The Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, \n1996, mandates comprehensive welfare measures for women construction workers. These measures \ninclude provisions for \ufb01rst aid facilities to address immediate health needs, the availability of clean, \naccessible, and separate toilets to ensure sanitation, the establishment of canteens to provide food during \nworking hours, the provision of cr\u00e8ches for the childcare, and the provision of restrooms to facilitate a \ncomfortable working environment. The Act enhances the overall well- being and working conditions of \nwomen construction workers by ensuring access to essential amenities and services at construction sites. \n(Under BOCW cess fund, there is provision of Maternity bene\ufb01t.
